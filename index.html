        <h1 class="headings">Inessa &amp; Nora</h1>
        <p>Inessa and I met when in second grade at Lomond School in Shaker Heights, Ohio. Inessa was tiny and blonde and was still new to the United States - she and her parents moved from Lund, Sweden the year prior so her parents could work at the Cleveland Clinic. Inessa and I became fast friends - we played soccer, read and obsessed over Harry Potter, made crafts, and laughed all the time.</p>
        <p>After fourth grade, Inessa and her parents moved back to Sweden, though we knew we'd stay friends. Since then, we've hardly gone two years without seeing each other. She spent a summer with me in Shaker Heights and I spent a summer with her in Lund. We've traveled all over together, here are some of our adventures:
           <ul id="firstlist">

                <li>New York City, New York (to watch Inessa run the Marathon!)</li>

        <h2 class="headings">19th Friendaversary Trip</h2>
        <p>This past August, we both had some time off and decided to take a trip through New England. We started at her great uncle's house in Stonington, Connecticut, then to Stony Brook, New York, to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and finally to New York City. Here are some of the pictures from our trip:</p>
